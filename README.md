# Draw
An in-development application for Drawing and Image Manipulation written in FreePascal using CodeTyphon and Lazarus by René Hickersberger.
I've made this program back in 2013 and I was not very experienced. I think there are some bugs in it. Please let me know in the Issues tab if you found a bug, I'm interested in fixing it. I'm very busy right now, but I want to continue the project soon (but I'm not sure when).

# Building

  1. Download and install [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus-ide.org) or [CodeTyphon](http://www.pilotlogic.com/sitejoom/index.php/codetyphon)
  2. Clone this repository (```git clone https://github.com/ReneHSZ/Draw.git```)
  3. Open Draw.lpi with Lazarus or CodeTyphon
  4. Click on Run -> Compile to build it
  
Done!
Click on Run -> Run to run it or execute the Draw.exe file
